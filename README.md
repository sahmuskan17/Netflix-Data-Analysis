# Netflix-Data-Analysis
The dataset focuses on Netflix content, detailing various aspects like the title, director, cast, release year, and more. It provides valuable insights into the types of shows and movies available, their origins (countries), when they were added to Netflix, and their ratings.With information on directors and cast, it offers a glimpse into the creative minds behind the content. Users can explore trends, such as popular genres or countries contributing the most content.The objective of this project is to analyze the Netflix dataset to gain insights into viewer preferences and content trends. 
By exploring various attributes such as title, director, cast, release year, country of origin, ratings, and genre, we aim to answer several key questions:
1.Who are the most influential directors in shaping Netflix's content landscape?
2.What are the top countries contributing to Netflix's content library?
3.Who are the most prominent actors featured in Netflix productions?
4.In which year was the highest volume of content produced on Netflix?
5.How are ratings distributed across the Netflix content library?
6.In which year most of the movies released?
